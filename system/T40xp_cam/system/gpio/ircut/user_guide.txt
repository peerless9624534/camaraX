1. link "open_ircut.sh, close_ircut.sh, gpio_init"  to device /system/bin directory;
2. After the device is powered on, the serial port (or Telnet) will be put into the file directory: 
	$ cd /system/bin/
3. Execute “gpio_init“ to initialize GPIO port:
	$ ./gpio_init
4. Select to perform open or close IRcut:
	$ ./open_ircut.sh       or
	$ ./close_ircut.sh
5. Check the video effect through THE RTSP pull stream;
Through shell command viewing ircut control high and low level of port, after switched all values are 0
